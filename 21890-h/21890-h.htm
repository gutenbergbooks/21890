<h3 class="ptitle" id="ph01">The Path to Home</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's the mother at the doorway, and the children at the gate,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the little parlor windows with the curtains white and straight.</span><br />
<span class="i0">There are shaggy asters blooming in the bed that lines the fence,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the simplest of the blossoms seems of mighty consequence.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Oh, there isn't any mansion underneath God's starry dome</span><br />
<span class="i0">That can rest a weary pilgrim like the little place called home.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men have sought for gold and silver; men have dreamed at night of fame;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the heat of youth they've struggled for achievement's honored name;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But the selfish crowns are tinsel, and their shining jewels paste,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the wine of pomp and glory soon grows bitter to the taste.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For there's never any laughter, howsoever far you roam,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like the laughter of the loved ones in the happiness of home.</span><br />
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is nothing so important as the mother's lullabies,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Filled with peace and sweet contentment, when the moon begins to rise&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nothing real except the beauty and the calm upon her face</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the shouting of the children as they scamper round the place.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the greatest of man's duties is to keep his loved ones glad</span><br />
<span class="i0">And to have his children glory in the father they have had.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So where'er a man may wander, and whatever be his care,</span><br />
<span class="i0">You'll find his soul still stretching to the home he left somewhere.</span><br />
<span class="i0">You'll find his dreams all tangled up with hollyhocks in bloom,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the feet of little children that go racing through a room,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the happy mother smiling as she watches them at play&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">These are all in life that matter, when you've stripped the sham away.</span><br />

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Isn't it fine when the day is done,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the petty battles are lost or won,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the gold is made and the ink is dried,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To quit the struggle and turn aside</span><br />
<span class="i0">To spend an hour with your boy in play,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let him race all of your cares away?</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Isn't it fine when the day's gone well,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When you have glorious tales to tell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And your heart is light and your head is high.</span><br />
<span class="i0">For nothing has happened to make you sigh,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To hurry homewards to share the joy</span><br />
<span class="i0">That your work has won with a little boy?</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Isn't it fine, whether good or bad</span><br />
<span class="i0">Has come to the hopes and the plans you had,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the day is over, to find him there,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thinking you splendid and just and fair,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ready to chase all your griefs away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And soothe your soul with an hour of play?</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, whether the day's been long or brief,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whether it's brought to me joy or grief,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whether I've failed, or whether I've won,</span><br />
<span class="i0">It shall matter not when the work is done;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I shall count it fine if I end each day</span><br />
<span class="i0">With a little boy in an hour of play.</span><br />

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You're spoiling them!" the mother cries</span><br />
<span class="i0">When I give way to weepy eyes</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let them do the things they wish,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like cleaning up the jelly dish,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or finishing the chocolate cake,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Or maybe let the rascal take</span><br />
<span class="i0">My piece of huckleberry pie,</span><br />

<span class="i0">When I am heedless to their yells,</span><br />

<span class="i0">And do not put their joy to rout.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I know I should be firm, and yet</span><br />
<span class="i0">I tried it once to my regret;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I will remember till I'm old</span><br />
<span class="i0">The day I started in to scold.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stamped my foot and shouted: "Stop!"</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Bud just let his drum sticks drop,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And looked at me, and turned away;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That night there was no further play.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The girls were solemn-like and still,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Just as girls are when they are ill,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And when unto his cot I crept,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I found him sobbing as he slept.</span><br />
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">15</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That was my first attempt and last</span><br />

<span class="i0">So quickly and has left no trace</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of memory on each little face;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But now when mother whispers low:</span><br />
<span class="i0">"You're spoiling them," I answer, "No!</span><br />

<span class="i0">At first the portal slips ajar in answer to your ringing,</span><br />

<span class="i0">I like to get to thinking of the old days that are gone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When there were joys that never more the world will look upon,</span><br />

<span class="i0">And made, what seemed but luxuries then, the joys of every day;</span><br />
<span class="i0">When bathrooms were exceptions, and we got our weekly scrub</span><br />
<span class="i0">By standing in the middle of a little wooden tub.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We had no rapid heaters, and no blazing gas to burn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">We boiled the water on the stove, and each one took his turn.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sometimes to save expenses we would use one tub for two;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The water brother Billy used for me would also do,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Although an extra kettle I was granted, I admit,</span><br />
<span class="i0">On winter nights to freshen and to warm it up a bit.</span><br />

<span class="i0">But if the nights were very cold, by closing every door</span><br />
<span class="i0">We were allowed to take our bath upon the kitchen floor.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Beside the cheery stove we stood and gave ourselves a rub,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In comfort most luxurious in that old wooden tub.</span><br />
</div>

<span class="i0">No little flying forms go past, too swift to see their charms,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With shirts and underwear and things tucked underneath their arms;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The home's so full of luxury now, it's almost like a club,</span><br />
